<h1>introduction</h1>
<p>This project is aimed to achieve an interaction between SuperCollider, Arduino and Processing. The data(x axis, y axis and z) generated from the joystick on the Arduino can be sent to SuperCollider by OSC to be used as parameters of sound effect. By this way, the soundfile can be modified and the effect can be changed. Also, these parameters will also be sent to Processing to visualize the operation.</p>
